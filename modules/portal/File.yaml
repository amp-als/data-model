    description: Model for file on the AMP-ALS portal - union of clinical and omic file types
    notes:
    - There will be mappings available to this target schema from various source schemas stored in Core Models or under mappings/*
    - This schema inherits from BaseFile and combines attributes from both clinical and omic file types for backward compatibility
    - Uses mixins to avoid code duplication and maintain clean inheritance hierarchy
