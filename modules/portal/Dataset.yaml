# Dataset Union Schema
# Uses inheritance and mixins for clean code organization
# Maintains backward compatibility while supporting both clinical and omic datasets

    mixins: [ClinicalDatasetMixin, OmicDatasetMixin]
    description: Model for dataset on the AMP-ALS portal - union of clinical and omic dataset types
    notes:
    - There will be mappings available to this target schema from various source schemas stored in Core Models or under mappings/*
    - This schema inherits from BaseDataset and combines attributes from both clinical and omic dataset types for backward compatibility
    - Uses mixins to avoid code duplication and maintain clean inheritance hierarchy
