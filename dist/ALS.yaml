This technique is used to study how a cell responds when electric current enters a cell; this is important for instance for understanding how neurons respond to neurotransmitters that act by opening membrane ion channels.

After bead-capture, the DNA is linearized via restriction enzymes, and can be sequenced using adapter primers facing in outward [reverse/forward (RF)] directions.  These library inserts are considered jumping because the ends originate from distal genomic DNA sequences and are ligated adjacent to one another during circularization.

      optical coherence tomography:
        description: >
          Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) combines the principles of ultrasound with the imaging performance of a microscope.  OCT uses infrared light waves that reflect off the internal microstructure within the biological tissues.  The frequencies and bandwidths of infrared light are orders of magnitude higher than medical ultrasound signals, resulting in greatly increased image resolution, 8-25 times greater than any existing modality.  In addition to providing high-level resolutions for the evaluation of microanatomic structures OCT is also able to provide information regarding tissue composition. OCT is most widely used in ophthalmology.
